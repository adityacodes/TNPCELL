                      The College Of Engineering And Technology has a glorious past of more than 10 years and has been widely acclaimed for its excellence in education, research and training. A special emphasis is laid on total personality development along with the quality education and technical training of the students. College OF Engineering And Technology is fully networked with industry, as well as with academic/scientific community. It has active collaborations with leading universities and industries in India and abroad. <br><br>
                      College OF Engineering And Technology has kept the quality of education and research as its main focus of academic and professional activities and this has earned a high reputation in the country and abroad as is evident from CET figuring several times among the top ten engineering institutions in the country along with the IITs. Alumni, Staff, students and supporters take pride in having contributed to the College OF Engineering And Technology reputation as India's flagship, research-led university, known for the excellence of its teaching, research, and service to its local, national and international communities. Our challenge for the future is to build on this strong base to establish ourselves firmly among the world's leading universities.
